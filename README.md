# Task Summary

## Practical Task 1: Insurance Regression :blue_car:	

### What I Have Done:
- Created a Jupyter notebook named `insurance_regression.ipynb`.
- Imported `insurance.csv` dataset.
- Plotted a scatter plot to analyze how age affects insurance costs.
- Fitted a linear regression model to the data and made predictions.
- Visualized the best-fit line on the scatter plot.

## Practical Task 2: Diabetes Regression :hospital:	

### What I Have Done:
- Created a Jupyter notebook named `diabetes_regression.ipynb`.
- Read `diabetes_updated.csv` into the notebook.
- Differentiated between independent and dependent variables.
- Split the data into training and test sets (80% training, 20% test).
- Identified features requiring StandardScaler and applied it to appropriate features.
- Generated a multiple linear regression model using the training set.
- Printed out the intercept and coefficients of the trained model.
- Made predictions for the test set and compared them with original data.
- Computed R-squared for the model on the test set.

## Practical Task 3: Machine Learning Concepts :computer:	

### What I Have Done:
- Answered questions in the provided document `machine_learning.ipynb`.
- Described possible inputs and outputs for different examples.
- Determined appropriate machine learning algorithms for given case studies.
- Analyzed whether supervised or unsupervised learning is suitable for specific real-world problems.
- Determined the appropriateness of utilizing semi-supervised machine learning algorithms for certain tasks.

Overall, these tasks have provided me with hands-on experience in data analysis, regression modeling, and understanding various machine learning concepts and applications.
